# Analysis of kickerstarter campaigns
Analysis on Kickstarter campaigns to understand trends among plays and musicals worldwide
This file focuses on the goal and pledged money in successful and failed campaigns. The trends have been highlighted through different pivot tables and visualizations. We can make a decision with Louise as to when to launch a campaign and how much to save as the goal from the data attached. According to the data, the best time to launch a campaign for a play would be between May and June. In addition, the goal budget should be close to $5,000 - should not be higher than $10,000. ---
Attached are graphs and charts to represent the data in the analysis.
