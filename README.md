# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This project came together as a means to deliver information to Louise and her staff as to the outcome of other theater/play campaigns in regards to their launch date and fundraising goals. There are two objectives to the project. Firstly, to look at whether campaigns were successful or not based on their launch date. Secondly, to examine the outcome of campaigns based on fundraising goals set by the campaign. The results, as well as the data collected and visualizations from the project will be sent to Louise and her campaign staff.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of the data began by examining the outcomes of campaigns compared with the month they began with. I started by creating a pivot table to quickly summarize the data and show me an overview of the data. Then, I filtered the data to solely look at theater campaigns. Subsequently, I added both the campaign outcomes and launch month. 
  This pivot table informs how many successful, failed, or cancelled theater campaigns were launched in a categorical month. In addition, I created a line chart, shown below, to visualize the data over the twelve months. Through this, I was able to see any trends or peaks of data within the successful or failed campaigns.

  In this data, there are three significant trends that can signify a correlation. First, as seen in the graph, there is a trend of theater campaigns being successful when launching between April and May. Second, there is a sizable trend in failed campaigns between September and October. Finally, there is a downfall in successful campaigns between October and December. Analyzing these trends is significant to gaining a full picture of the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The analysis of outcomes based on goals began by creating a table showed how many successful, failed, cancelled, total projects, percentage successful, percentage failed, and percentage cancelled in regards to the fundraising goals. The fundraising goals are divided by less than 1,000, in groups of 5,000 (for example, 1,000 to 4,999, 5,000 to 9,999, and so on) until 49,999, and over 50,000.  I listed the outcome and percentage outcome for each group of fundraising goals. Finally, I filtered the data to solely show play campaigns. The table allows me to see how the percentage and number of successful, failed, and cancelled play campaigns change as the fundraising goals increase. Once I have the table laid out, I created a line graph, attached below, to visualize the data — the chart is attached below. The graph allows me to see the trends and peaks in the successful and failed play campaigns as the fundraising goals increase.

  There are three trends in this data which will help make the conclusion. First, as the fundraising goals rise in monetary amount, the percentage of successful campaigns trends downward — with the exception of two fundraising goals. Second, the number of overall play campaigns goes down as fundraising goals.
   The most number of play campaigns have a budget between $1000-$4999. Finally, the highest percentage of failed play campaigns have a budget of $45,000 and over. These data trends help us with fully analyzing the data; thus, making a conclusion from the data. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  While working with this data set, I did not encounter any specific challenges or difficulties. With handling a data set this large, there could potentially be various challenges. Filtering data through functions or through filtering columns can often bring challenges. A common mistake is re-filtering data or adding a filter where it should not be added. This may alter the data one is using for the analysis.  Another challenge may be with a data set this large, it’s possible to enter the wrong column or row into functions or column names into pivot tables. Such an action may possibly change how the data may look in a graph and may not represent the correct analysis. 
  
## Results

#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The trends in the data can help narrow the data to at least two conclusions for the outcomes based on launch date. First, there is a clear correlation between launching a play campaign in May and the success of a campaign. Finally, there is a correlation between launching a campaign between September and December and the possible failure of the campaign. To explain these correlations, the launch month may not be what is causing the campaign to succeed or fail — other factors may be present. Speaking from what the data tells us, we can find the correlation between the launch dates and campaign outcomes.

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There are three trends in this data can help us make a conclusion on outcomes based on goals. There is a correlation between setting a fundraising goal between less than $1,000 and $14,999 and between $35,000 and $44,999 and successful campaigns. In other words, success of a campaign is correlated with comparatively lower fundraising goals. The higher a fundraising goal is — especially above $45,000 — there may be a less chance of running a successful play campaign. 


#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are limitations within the dataset. First, there is no data for the genre of the play. For example, it’s possible that comedy plays are more successful than dramatic plays. Another limitation may be marketing techniques — for example, the more successful campaigns have television ads, billboards, and radio ads whereas the failed campaigns solely went off word of mouth. One other limitation is the lack of a venue and a city or state the play will be held at. If the play is planned to be held at a small school theater in a rural town, it may not be as successful as, for example, a large theater hall in New York City. The venue and city or state of where the play would be held in would help gauge if this is a factor affecting outcome. 

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The areas of the city/town of focus for advertising/funding — this way can semi-accurately gauge where to allocate the funds for the venue.  Additional tables that can be made from the original dataset is comparing the percentage funded with the outcome of the campaign or comparing the average donation with the outcome of the play campaign. For the individual projects, some extra graphs that could be created is a clustered or a stacked bar chart for looking at campaigns based on launch date. This would help compare the number of successful to failed campaigns per month. For the outcomes based on goals project, pie charts could be created by summing the total number of successful as well as the total number of failed and taking the percentages of each goal vs the total number and creating two pie charts from this data. Other graphs that can be created in this project are cluster and stacked bar graphs
